# Trapping Rain Water

Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is `1`, compute how much water it can trap after raining.


## Examples:

![Example](image.png)

Input: `height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]`
Output: `6`
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array `[0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]`. In this case, `6` units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.


Input: `height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]`
Output: `9`

## Difficulty:

`hard`
