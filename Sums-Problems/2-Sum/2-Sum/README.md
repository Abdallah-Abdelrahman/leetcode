# Two Sum

Given an array of integers `nums` and an `integer` target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.


## Examples:
|Iput|Output|Explanation
-----|------|----------
`nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9`|`[0,1]`|`Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].`
`nums = [3,2,4], target = 6`|`[1,2]`| 
`nums = [3,3], target = 6`|`[0,1]`|

## Difficulty:

`easy`

## Learning Objectives:

+ Array
+ Hash Table
